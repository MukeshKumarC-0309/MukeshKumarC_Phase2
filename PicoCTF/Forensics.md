Decode this message from the moon.          

## Solution
First we receive a audio file which seems to be unlike a music file.Hence when i looked for clues,it said 'how did the picutres send from moon to earth'.The answer is SSTV.Hence I figured out that the audio was a SSTV file and hence we need a tool which helps us convert a SSTV file into something readable/viewable like a photo.Hence we open up a random online convertor which reads the sstv audio file and converts into a readable image.

picoCTF{beep_boop_im_in_Space}     

## Concepts Learnt 
I learnt about a new form of audio file which is SSTV signals(Slow-Scan Television) which was used to send pictures from moon to the earth.I learnt to use the available tools on the internet which help convert signals to a viewable Picture.
