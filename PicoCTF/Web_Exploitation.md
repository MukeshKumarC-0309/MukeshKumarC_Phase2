I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out!

## Solution
So From the title itself,i guess this had to be a server side template injection.For that,i needed to know what backend was being used.So on searching for different backends,i finally figured out that it was a jinja2 backend.Hence we need to get its payload to execute commands which is '{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read()}}'.Hence we put 'ls' instead of id to get the file contents.We find a file named flag which could hold our value.Hence we use 'cat flag' to get the flag value in the end.

'''

{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat flag').read()}}

## Flag
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_bdc95c1a}

## Concepts Learnt
I learnt the concept of server side template injection and how one can use certain commands to figure out what kind of backend is being used.I also learnt about the use of payloads which help in executing commands in Web dev.
