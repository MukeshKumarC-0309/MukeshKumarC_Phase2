# 1.IQ Test
We have to find the flag value by solving certain challenges            

## Solution
So we receive 2 files in a google drive,a png file and an instructions file.On opening the file we see that we have to take the input as some number and in the end finish computing everything and get values{y0,y1,.......,y11} which we wrap around the nite flag.Hence when we open the png file,we are greeted with a bunch of logic gates with a combination of them leading to y0,some to y1 etc.On the input side we see x0,x1,......,x35 as inputs.So We know that we need to convert our input into binary,assign the digits to their respective positions.And then we started solving the gates one by one.Hence we get all 12 values and then we wrap it around nite{}.

## Flag
nite{010000000011}              

## Concepts Learnt
I learnt on how to convert decimal to binary and use it in different logic gates such as NOT,OR,AND,NAND,NOR,XOR and get the respective outputs.
