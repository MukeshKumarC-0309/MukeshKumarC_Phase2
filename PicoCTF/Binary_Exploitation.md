# 1.Buffer Overflow 0
Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available here. You can view source here.
Connect using:
nc saturn.picoctf.net 53361

## Solution
So,in this challenge we are given a c file and a nc connection which when established asks for an input and possibly gives the flag if the answer is right.So I begin by inspecting the source code which was given to us,i see that there's a buffer buf2 which can be exploited to get the desired result.I see that the buffer length is 16 and giving some value higher than that could result in a buffer overflow which would call the sig handler function which gives us the flag.Another thing to note is that the input is still taken in by the 'gets()' function.gets() is a function which is no longer in use because it’s dangerous as it has no limit.Hence i set up the connection and when it asks for the input,i just give 'A' some n number of times > 16 and voila!,we get the flag.

## Flag
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}            

## Concepts Learnt
I learnt what a buffer overflow is and how it can be used to bypass certain logic in the code and in this exploit it to get the end result.
