# 1.Buffer Overflow 0
Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available here. You can view source here.

## Solution
So,in this challenge we are given a c file and a nc connection which when established asks for an input and possibly gives the flag if the answer is right.So I begin by inspecting the source code which was given to us,i see that there's a buffer buf2 which can be exploited to get the desired result.I see that the buffer length is 16 and giving some value higher than that could result in a buffer overflow which would call the sig handler function which gives us the flag.Another thing to note is that the input is still taken in by the 'gets()' function.gets() is a function which is no longer in use because it’s dangerous as it has no limit.Hence i set up the connection and when it asks for the input,i just give 'A' some n number of times > 16 and voila!,we get the flag.

## Concepts Learnt
I learnt what a buffer overflow is and how it can be used to bypass certain logic in the code and in this exploit it to get the end result.

## Solution
Here,again we have been given a C source code and an nc connection.Establishing the nc connection gives us the menu and asks us to choose a 'big' order.When inspecting the code,i found that i had to give an input whose size is greater than 64(2*buf size),hence i chose Gr%114d_Cheese because of '%114d' which prints a number of 114 bytes long and if no input is given,it just prints garbage value.Hence it prints a value,greater than 64,which succesfully solves the 1st level,in the next level it again asks us for something 'outrageous' which could indicate some input that would overwhelm the program,hence when i look through the option,i find 'Cla%sic_Che%s%steak' which has '%s' format specifiers,so i knew if i gave it just like that without any inputs,it would crash,which could mean what the challenge wants,so i give it and yes,we get the flag successfully.

## Concepts Learnt
I learnt how to bypass buffers to cause them to overflow or break which can bypass certain conditions and i learnt the use of format specifiers and how they are used.
