Let's decrypt this: ciphertext? Something seems a bit small.

## Solution
So this just involves basic decryption according to the RSA algorithm.We have been given a text file which contains the ciphertext,the public key e and the public key value.So all we need to do is to decode the message according to the algorithm.Hence i look up for online decoders and found one.I substituted in the values and recovered the flag successfully.

## Flag
picoCTF{n33d_a_lArg3r_e_606ce004}            


## Concepts Learnt 
I learnt abt the RSA encryption method and how we can encrypt or decrypt messages with the help of public key.I also learnt the use of RSA decoders which can help decrypt messages.
