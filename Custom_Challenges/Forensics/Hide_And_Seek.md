# Hide and Seek
  
## My Approach
So,in the challenge it says to use stegseek to find the hidden message.Hence I download stegseek from the online resources and i use the help command to see the command i need to use to find the hidden message.It says that we also have to use a wordlist as argument.Hence we use the most used wordlist 'rockyou.txt' as the argument and pass the file and store the text in a different text file.Fortunately,the password is present in the file,hence unlocking the hidden message.Then it is stored in the text file which we can cat out successfully.

# RAR Of The Abyss

## My Approach
So,in the challenge it says that the information is hidden deep inside.Hence i open the pcap file to analyse the network and i see that a lot of information is being sent across the network.So as i scroll through that,i see some specific messages such as the 'password is..' and other messages.Finally I stumble upon a RAR file,which is indicated by the challenge name.Hence i convert into raw data for us to read it.Once done,i open up the zip file,which gives us a text file which when opened gives us the answer.
